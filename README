ABOUT:

This application lets a user download in CSV format the Facebook Insights data
about an application or page owned by the user.

This is a sample application that uses the Facebook Insights API.  The API
consists of an FQL table with four queryable columns and one value column.  The
query columns are object_id, metric, end_time, and period.  Insights are also
available for Facebook Pages and Applications via the Graph API at
https://graph.facebook.com/ID/insights.  For more information, see the FQL
Insights developer documentation at
http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api#Analytics, or the Facebook Developers
Forum at http://forum.developers.facebook.com/ for answers to commonly asked
questions.
